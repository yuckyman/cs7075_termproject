# CS7075 Term Project: 3D KUKA Arm Gesture Control

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a term project focused on developing gesture control for a 3D KUKA robotic arm. The project aims to create an intuitive interface for controlling the robotic arm using hand gestures, leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure
- `gesture_pid/` - Main project code for gesture recognition and PID control
- `articles/` - Research papers and reference materials
- `notes/` - Project documentation and meeting notes
- `deprecated/` - Legacy code and deprecated implementations
- `venv/` - Python virtual environment (not tracked in git)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuckyman/cs7075_termproject.git
   ```

2. Set up the Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   # or
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Status
